# ProPublica API Integration
This is a Python project I created based on a job posting on UpWork. Never heard back from the client but I have pretty much come up with an initial solution based on the requirements they posted and making some assumptions.

**NOTE: this code represents a specific point in time in my ongoing learning of Python. Certain code usage or patterns don't necessarily represent how I might code today.**

# Background
The requirements were as follows:
1) retrieve data from an API at ProPublica.org (https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/nonprofit-explorer-api)
2) make use of an Excel spreadsheet that contains information about what data to retrieve from the API and also a sample layout of the output
3) create a CSV output file of the data

The project was a fixed cost of $30US and a duration of "less than a week". I came up with a solution in about that duration and about half that time in effort. Given the cost, fancy was not the focus. Something that works and ideally doesn't blow up was.

# Major Functions
The application performs the following major functions.
